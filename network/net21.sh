# 8. Configure a Network Bridge
# All the virtual machines on the host are by default connected to the same NAT-type virtual network, named 'default'.

# --------------------------------------------
#  default   active   yes         yes
# Note: If you use Debian, the default network state will be inactive, and autostart will be disabled. To activate, run the command sudo virsh net-start default followed by sudo virsh net-autostart default.
# The virtual machines that use this 'default' network will be assigned an IP address in the 192.168.124.0/24 address space, with the host OS reachable at 192.168.124.1.

 sudo virsh net-dumpxml default | xmllint --xpath '//ip' -
# <ip address="192.168.124.1" netmask="255.255.255.0">
#     <dhcp>
#       <range start="192.168.124.2" end="192.168.124.254"/>
#     </dhcp>
# </ip>
# Virtual machines using this default network will only have outbound network access. Virtual machines will have full access to network services, but devices outside the host will be unable to communicate with virtual machines inside the host. For example, the virtual machine can browse the web but cannot host a web server that is accessible to the outside world.

# If you want virtual machines to be directly visible on the same physical network as the host and visible to external devices, you must use a network bridge.

# A network bridge is a link-layer device that connects two local area networks into one network. In this case, a software bridge is used within a Linux host to simulate a hardware bridge. As a result, all other physical machines on the same physical network of the host can detect and access virtual machines. The virtual machine, for example, can browse the web, and will also be able to host a web server that is accessible to the outside world.
# Important:

# Unfortunately, you cannot set up a network bridge when using Wi-Fi.

# Due to the IEEE 802.11 standard which specifies the use of 3-address frames in Wi-Fi for the efficient use of airtime, you cannot configure a bridge over Wi-Fi networks operating in Ad-Hoc or Infrastructure modes.

# First, find the name of the interface you want to add to the bridge. In my case, it is enp2s0.
